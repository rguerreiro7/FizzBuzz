# FizzBuzz

This repo contains the source code of my solution for the exercise:

```
Create a loop that will print all the numbers for the range, 1-20. If the number is:

  divisible by 3, print 'Fizz'

  divisible by 5, print 'Buzz'

  divisible by 3 &amp; 5, 'FizzBuzz'

  otherwise print the number
  ```
